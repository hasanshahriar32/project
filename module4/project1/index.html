    Loki spends his first two films in the MCU as a full-fledged villain, before ultimately changing his ways, but was he born a bad guy or made that way? Of all the characters to die in the MCU so far, Loki is up there as one of the saddest. Sure, not as sad as Iron Man or Black Widow, but definitely top tier. After struggling with his dueling love and hate for his brother for three films, the god of mischief finally acted like a hero in the last act of Thor: Ragnarok.</p>
